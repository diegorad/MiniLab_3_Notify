# MiniLab_3_Relative
MIDI remote script and translation layer for a "Relative DAW" mode for the Arturia MiniLab 3 controller in Ableton.

The MiniLab_3_Rel is a modified version of the official MIDI control script included in Ableton 12 for the MiniLab 3. It includes a modification in the elements.py module which tells Ableton to expect relative (LinearBinaryOffset) values from the MiniLab 3 knobs.
